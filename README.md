Two simple modals.

1. A custom one: just as an example for you to see how one could build a modal from scratch.

2. A Tailwind one, with lots of love and fancy stuff. Copied from [here](https://tailwindui.com/components/application-ui/overlays/modals)


NOTE: The last one requires you to install the package `@headlessui/react`

Have fun ðŸ’™
